# Repository overview
This repository contains the assignments for the course Understanding Bioinformatic Pipelines.
So far, we have learned how to carry out RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, scRNA-seq and methylation assays. Additionally, approaches we have seen protocols related to multiome analysis.

This repository contains folders for each class. Next, I present the location of homework files (either pdf or rmd files) across the folders:

- For the assignments related to RNA-seq:
  
```/class_1/hw_1```

```/class_2/```

- For ATAC-seq:

```/class_3-4/hw```

- For scRNA-seq:

```class_5/Group4_results```

```class_6```

Additionally, the complete snake make project can found [here](https://github.com/dasotortiz/dea_seurat)

- For multiomic analysis:

```class_7```

- For methylation:

```class_8```
